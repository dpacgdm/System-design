# Answer Key — Design Configuration Store

> Open only after attempting the learner file questions.

## Expert Analysis
### Question 1-4 Worked Answers

```
ROOT CAUSE:
  DB quota exceeded → write rejection → apiserver failures
  Compaction disabled/missed → unbounded revision history
  Large ConfigMaps accelerated growth
  Broad watches amplified read load during recovery attempts

IMMEDIATE:
  1. Stop rogue controller watching / (identify via metrics)
  2. etcdctl compact + defrag on leader (after snapshot)
  3. Delete unnecessary ConfigMaps / move blobs to S3
  4. Temporarily raise quota ONLY after defrag (not before)

WATCH AMPLIFICATION:
  Each apiserver LIST/WATCH on / sends events for ALL changes
  During churn, event rate exceeds network capacity

LONG-TERM:
  Auto-compaction (--auto-compaction-retention=1h)
  Defrag cron, db size alerts at 70%
  Admission webhook reject ConfigMap > 1MB
  Controller informers must use scoped watches
  Dedicated etcd cluster with NVMe, 5 nodes for prod

## Design Gates (mandatory) - Model Responses

These responses are intentionally gate-shaped rather than a second full design.
Use them to verify the design explicitly covers trust, abuse, tenancy, cost,
and blast radius.

### Gate 1 - Authn/z trust boundary

- State every principal: external user, internal service, admin/support actor,
  background worker, tenant, and third-party partner where applicable.
- Put the first trust boundary at the public edge or private service ingress,
  then name the enforcement point that owns object/action authorization.
- Accept only scoped identity artifacts with issuer, audience, expiry, and
  key/certificate validation. Service-to-service calls should use workload
  identity or mTLS, not ambient network trust.
- Fail closed for money, privacy, admin, and write paths. Degrade or serve
  cached public content only where policy explicitly allows it.

### Gate 2 - Abuse and misuse

- Identify the highest-amplification actor in `Design Configuration Store`: the one that can turn
  one request into many writes, fetches, fan-outs, model calls, or downstream
  retries.
- Use layered quotas: user/API key, tenant/tier, entity key, endpoint/job
  class, region/cell, and global safety cap.
- Distinguish organic flash traffic from abuse with per-key skew, user-agent
  or principal entropy, retry rate, error mix, and historical baselines.
- Bound retries with budgets, jitter, circuit breakers, and idempotency keys.

### Gate 3 - Multi-tenant isolation

- Name the tenancy model for every stateful plane: relational data, cache,
  queue/topic, object storage, search index, model/vector store, metrics, logs,
  and support exports.
- Tenant context must be explicit in APIs, async messages, cache keys, search
  filters, audit logs, and support tooling. Missing tenant context fails closed.
- Reserve or quota shared scarce resources: DB connections, Kafka partitions
  and bytes, cache memory/ops, worker concurrency, indexing bandwidth, and
  third-party API calls.
- Prove isolation with cross-tenant cache/search/export tests, route-map tests,
  and incident kill switches for one tenant or cell.

### Gate 4 - Unit cost at target scale

- Define one business unit and compute order-of-magnitude cost at target scale
  and at peak multiplier. Include idle headroom and replication, not only
  request CPU.
- Dominant line items usually include storage retention, egress/cross-AZ or
  cross-region transfer, observability ingest, model/API calls, NAT, cache
  memory, and replay/rebuild capacity.
- Page on cost per successful business unit and slope by feature/deploy/tenant,
  not only monthly spend after the fact.
- Preferred degradation cuts optional analytics, freshness, ranking depth,
  export concurrency, or non-critical replicas before correctness-critical
  writes and reads.

### Gate 5 - Failure blast radius

- Declare the intended blast-radius boundary: partition, shard, tenant, topic,
  cell, region, queue, worker pool, cache namespace, or model version.
- Separate critical and non-critical paths so analytics, exports, replay,
  recommendation/ranking, or support tooling cannot starve checkout, payment,
  auth, or core serving.
- Document runbook hazards: global cache flush, raising max connections,
  disabling auth, removing rate limits, replaying without throttle, or widening
  a feature flag globally.
- Game day the highest-risk boundary and verify alerts fire before customer or
  tenant-wide impact.
